<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey There, 
  Meet me! Well I know you are smiling already, but that is what describes me!
  Welcome to my page and I am Shivangi who is going to give you a tour of my self created website. 
  Interesting right!
</p>

<p>I completed my Master in Computer Applications recently and have been working in TCS since 3.8 years.
  Well yeah..you hear that right.. I was very excited when i got selected in the company. 
  I actuall worked hard for something. I was very happy since it was my first actual job.
</p>

<p>Since, I am a frontend Java developer here, I got to know about what actually being a developer is. 
  Trust me, it was a not an easy job, but I actually got to leran JQuery, which is great because I never 
  knew this existed! Lol, but it is fun. I have only known JavaScript, basic Python and have good searching skills.
  It was something new, because I did not learn this in my college days...I was actually interested in Linux in my 
  college days, but i lost my touch and now i remember nothing. If I start revising, maybe I can start again.
</p>

<p>I wanted to upskill myself because my current project uses legacy technology, so I have been learning frontend
  bootcamp so that I can understand what kind of more languages I can practice and have a good package.
